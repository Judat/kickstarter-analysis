# Overview of Project
The project was to check the trends in campaigns launched for "theater" and subcategory "plays". Try to make sense of avaialble data and see if the goals set and golas met had any impact by the amount and time of the year when the campain was launched. 

# Purpose
1: The purpose of the analysis was to check if there is any impact or correllation between the months and the outcome of the theatre campaigns launched over the years. 
2: Another side that i worked on was to check if the amount of funding set as a goal had any impact on the outcome of the campaign. 

# Analysis and Challenges

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For deliverable 1 (Theater Outcomes by Launch Date), I used pivot tables and line chart to see if there is any indiactaion that the launch date has any impact on the outcome of the campaign. i used the simple formula to extract the year from a date and filtered the date in my pivoit table to show only months of the year.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For deliverable 2 (Outcomes based on Goals) , i used countifs formula to break down the numbers of outcomes of plays from less than 1000 to greater than 50,000. Thisd helped me see the correlation between the amlunt of goal set and the outcome of campaign. Also, i used the line chart to showcase the corretaion between the amount of goal and the oputcome.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge is always to decide the best startegy to pull data and present it with usefull and effective graphic output. This problem was solved by the requiremnts itself. I think the challenge that i faced in this analysis is that checking one or two outcome is islotaion might not help me come up with a good and meaninful anlysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Conslsion 1 : From April onwards there is a gtrend of launching more campaigns as compared to the rest of the year and the trend continues till July
Conslusion 2: Due to more campigns launched in the months of May, June and July , we see the trend the these months also produce teh hiughest number of successfull outcomes. 
Which brings us to suggest that April to July is good time to start a campaign and chances of getting the suuccessful outcome atre higher

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Conclusion1: 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
